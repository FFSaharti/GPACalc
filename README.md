# GPACalc


this is a website that I have created that simply calculates the projected gpa for you, based on the grades that you think you have got in specific topic.
-- This criteria/calculation is based on the calculation that is followed by King AbdulAziz University

it can also calculate your cumulative GPA, as you have to input:

1. your previous completed hours.
2. your previous gpa
3. number of courses which you have taken this semester.

and then click calculate.
